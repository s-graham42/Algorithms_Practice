# My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.

# I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe.
# All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

# Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first.
# Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!

# To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

# The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (take_out_orders)
# The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dine_in_orders)
# Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by the kitchen. (served_orders)
# Given all three lists, write a function to check that my service is first-come, first-served.
# All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.

# We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.

# As an example,
#     Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
#     Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
#     Served Orders: [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]
# would not be first-come, first-served, since order 3 was requested before order 5 but order 5 was served first.

# But,

#     Take Out Orders: [17, 8, 24]
#     Dine In Orders: [12, 19, 2]
#     Served Orders: [17, 8, 12, 19, 24, 2]
# would be first-come, first-served.

# Note: Order numbers are arbitrary. They do not have to be in increasing order.
